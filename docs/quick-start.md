# Quick Start

## For Players
Just follow the setup guide, it also explains how to upload worlds to your server.  

That should be it.  

## For Authors
1. Follow the setup guide
2. For a working example examine [my example map](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/616) which includes the source Photoshop file as a separate download.
3. To see an example of authoring a new map from scratch see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuDieAlR6Kg) in which I use my [template file](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/446?tab=files). Use the chapters to see different parts of the process I am using.
4. To see how to take the exported image files from the previous step into the game, and create and verify the world see [this other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzO_cl_mTLA).
5. Check out the [settings](./settings/settings.html) so find out what the different config parameters do, and how to apply them using the console to a world, while in game.
