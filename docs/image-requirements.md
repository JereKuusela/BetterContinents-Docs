# Image Requirements

All the image maps must be:
* Less than or equal to 4096x4096
* Square (width the same as height)
* A power of two. This means the valid sizes are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 **only**.
* One of these formats: Png, Jpeg, Bmp, Gif, Tga, Png is **strongly** preferred as it gives the best combination of size and color representation for this system.

It is **not** necessary for all images to be the same format or size, you can mix and match.
