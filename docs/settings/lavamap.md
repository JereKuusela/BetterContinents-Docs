## Lava map

The lava map is an alternative way for defining where lava can appear. The other way is using alpha channel in the [paint map](paintmap.md).

The lava map only affects the Ashlands biome. This means you don't need to worry about affecting other biomes.

Lava appears when the greyness is above 60% of the maximum value (99 of FF).
