# Project
{: .no_toc }

The project setting allows the use of standardized names for the image maps to enable automatically using them from a specified directory.

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

---
## Directory
This directory will load automatically any existing map files matching the correct names, overriding specific files specified below.
Only png is supported using this method, however png is the recommended format in general as it supports both 16 bit grayscale, and 8 bit RGB, and these cover the requirements of all the image types.

### Filenames 
File Name | Target Setting

`heightmap.png` | [Heightmap File]
`roughmap.png` | [Roughmap File]

`spawnmap.png` | [Spawnmap File]

# Heightmap
## Heightmap File
Path to a heightmap file to use.
## Heightmap Amount
Multiplier of the height value from the heightmap file (more than 1 leads to higher max height than vanilla, good results are not guaranteed)
Default `1`
Range `0` to `5`
## Heightmap Blend
How strongly to blend the heightmap file into the final result
Default `1`
Range `0` to `1`
## Heightmap Add
How strongly to add the heightmap file to the final result (usually you want to blend it instead)
Default `0`
Range `-1` to `1`

# Roughmap
## Roughmap File
Path to a roughmap file to use.
## Roughmap Blend
How strongly to apply the roughmap file
Default `1`
Range `0` to `1`

# Flatmap
## Use Roughmap For Flatmap
Use the flatmap as the rough map, but inverted (black rough map results in totally flat terrain)
Default true
## Flatmap File
Path to a flatmap file to use.
## Flatmap Blend
How strongly to apply the flatmap file (also applies when using Use Roughmap For Flatmap)
Default `1`
Range `0` to `1`

# Biomemap
## Biomemap File
Path to a biomemap file to use.

# Forest
## Forest Scale
Scales forested/cleared area size
Default `0.5`
Range `0` to `1`
## Forest Amount
Adjusts how much forest there is, relative to clearings
Default `0.5`
Range `0` to `1`
## Forest Factor Overrides All Trees
Trees in all biomes will be affected by forest factor (both procedural and from forestmap)
Default false
## Forestmap File
Path to a forestmap file to use.
## Forestmap Multiply
How strongly to scale the vanilla forest factor by the forestmap
Default `1`
Range `0` to `1`
## Forestmap Add
How strongly to add the forestmap directly to the vanilla forest factor
Default `1`
Range `0` to `1`

# Spawnmap
## Spawnmap File
Path to a spawnmap file to use.

# Ridges
## Max Ridge Height
Max height of ridge features (set this to 0 to turn OFF ridges entirely)
Default `0.5`
Range `0` to `1`
## Ridge Size
Size of ridge features
Default `0.5`
Range `0` to `1`
## Ridge Blend
Smoothness of ridges blending into base terrain
Default `0.5`
Range `0` to `1`
## Ridge Amount
How much ridges
Default `0.5`
Range `0` to `1`

# StartPosition
## Override Start Position
Whether to override the start position using the values provided (warning: will disable all validation of the position)
Default false
## Start Position X
Start position override X value, in ranges -10500 to 10500
Default `0`
Range `-10500` to '`0500`
## Start Position Y
Start position override Y value, in ranges -10500 to 10500
Default `0`
Range `-10500` to `10500`

# Debug
## Debug Mode
Automatically reveals the full map on respawn, enables cheat mode, and debug mode, for debugging purposes
## Skip Default Location Placement
Skips default location placement during world gen (spawn temple and spawnmap are still placed), for quickly testing the heightmap itself
