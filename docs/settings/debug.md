# Debug

## Debug Mode
Automatically reveals the full map on respawn, enables cheat mode, and debug mode, for debugging purposes.

## Skip Default Location Placement
Skips default location placement during world gen (spawn temple and spawnmap are still placed), for quickly testing the heightmap itself.
