# Debug

## Debug Mode
{: .d-inline-block }
Setting
{: .label .label-green }

Automatically reveals the full map on respawn, enables cheat mode, and debug mode.

## Skip Default Location Placement
{: .d-inline-block }
Setting
{: .label .label-green }

Skips default location placement during world gen, the spawn temple and spawnmap items are still placed.
This is particularly useful when vanilla spawn placement during world creation is likely to fail, and you don't want to wait for it.
